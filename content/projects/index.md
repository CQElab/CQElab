        - title: Superconducting Qubits
          text: |-
            Our superconducting qubit is a nano-fabricated electrical circuit made of superconducting aluminum thin-film structures on a high-resistivity silicon substrate. When the device is cooled down to very close to absolute zero temperature (~10 mK) in our dilution refrigerators, it operates in the quantum regime, acting like an artificial atom, or in other words, a quantum bit (qubit). 
            <br><br>
            We have the freedom to design Hamiltonian parameters for individual qubits (imagine creating your own periodic table for these artificial atoms!), and for the interaction between qubits. We develop exquisite quantum control of qubits and create distinct quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, using on-chip microwave circuits and room temperature electronics like arbitrary waveform generators, IQ mixers, and FPGAs.

        - title: Atomic-Scale Defects
          text: |-
            Material defects are ubiquitous. Seven decades ago, defects posed a significant challenge to the newborn semiconductor industry, and today they continue to be a major obstacle for the emerging quantum technology. In particular, the performance of solid-state quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, is limited by atomic-scale defects at material surfaces and interfaces, posing a significant bottleneck to their scalability and practical utility. On the other hand, atomic-scale defects, once well-characterized, could be engineered into a useful quantum resource, as in the case of spin color centers in diamond.
            <br><br>
            This research aims to gain a profound understanding of the material defects in superconducting quantum circuits, and to engineer the defects in our favor for next-generation solid-state quantum devices for quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum communication.
