abstract: The power of quantum sensing rests on its ultimate precision limit, quantified by the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB), which can surpass classical bounds. In multi-parameter estimation, the QCRB is not always saturated as the quantum nature of associated observables may lead to their incompatibility. Here we explore the precision limits of multi-parameter estimation through the lens of quantum geometry, enabling us to experimentally evaluate the QCRB via quantum geometry measurements. Focusing on two- and three-parameter estimation, we elucidate how fundamental quantum uncertainty principles prevent the saturation of the bound. By linking a metric of "quantumness" to the system geometric properties, we investigate and experimentally extract the attainable QCRB for three-parameter estimations.
